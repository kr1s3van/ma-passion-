##  Overview
**Ma_Passion** is a web development project designed to showcase the competitive ecosystem of the video game *Splatoon 3*. 

Developed as part of my portfolio, this project demonstrates my ability to structure web content, implement custom styling without frameworks, and manage page transitions using vanilla JavaScript. It serves as a bridge between my technical skills in Frontend development and my personal interest in eSports strategy.

##  Features
*   **Multi-Page Navigation:** Seamless navigation between game mechanics (Weapons/Modes) and the professional scene (Tournaments/Leagues).
*   **Custom CSS Styling:**
    *   Unique visual identity matching the game's "pop" aesthetic.
    *   Use of Flexbox and Floats for layout management.
    *   Hover effects and custom typography.
*   **JavaScript Interactivity:**
    *   Smooth fade-in/fade-out page transitions (`opacity` manipulation).
    *   DOM Event listeners for load states.
*   **Rich Content:** Detailed breakdown of weapon classes and game modes using semantic HTML tags.
